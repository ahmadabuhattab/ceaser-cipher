# ceaser-cipher
Contains a encryptor and decryptor. You can input any message in the encryptor and it asks you for a shift number.
After that, you will have an encrypted message with a shift number.
This takes us to the next step where you must input the encrypted message and the shift amount in the decryptor to get the original message.
This project can go along way with encrypting and decrypting passwords or maybe even secret communication between devices.
